      <p>Software Developer</p>
      <h4>About Me</h4>

      <p>
        Hello! I'm a software developer currently at Leidos, where I work on air traffic management systems. My day-to-day
        tasks mostly include database management with PostgreSQL, or programming in Java, Python and C++.
      </p>

      <p>
        I graduated from Northern Michigan University in May 2024 with a degree in Computer Science. My programming
        experience primarily revolves around C++, Java, and Rust, though I have a keen interest in learning functional
        programming. Outside of work, I pursue side projects such as developing a small game in Rust using the Bevy
        engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about self-study, writing (I'm in the early stages of starting a blog!), and reading
        both fiction and nonfiction. I have competed at an international level in Olympic Weightlifting and have recently
        taken up running.
      </p>
