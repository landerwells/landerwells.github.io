<p>
I’m a software developer at Leidos, working on Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems. My team is currently developing the front end of the <a href="https://www.leidos.com/markets/aviation/air-traffic-management">Leidos Common Automation Platform (LCAP)</a> using modern C++ and the Qt framework to display critical information to ground controllers.
</p>


<p>
Previously, I’ve contributed to other major systems:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/tfdm">TFDM (Terminal Flight Data Manager)</a>: I was responsible for handling the data received by the sites, packaging it, and handing it off to the FAA. I also developed Python scripts to automate many tasks that had previously been done manually, reducing the time required for site development by approximately one day.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.leidos.com/insights/skyline-x-atm-overview">SkyLine-X</a>: I contributed to features such as Automated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA) and Data Set Reducer (DSR). ATPA provides visual cones in front of aircraft to indicate safe ranges when following other aircraft during arrivals. I developed the backend database logic that the C++ application relied on to retrieve this information, using Java, PostgreSQL, and C++. Data Set Reducer was designed to define areas around control towers in countries with limited bandwidth, ensuring that only messages within a specific radius were received. I implemented the entire backend for this feature, writing the system in Java, Python, and PostgreSQL to efficiently manage and filter the data before it reached the C++ frontend. Towards the end of the project, I also worked on tasks related to rendering the correct information on screen, integrating the backend data with the visual display.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/eram">ERAM (En Route Automation Modernization)</a>: While an intern at Leidos, I worked on the display team, fixing graphics and rendering bugs in the C++ application. This involved using GDB for debugging and XML to automate UI testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Outside of work, I am learning more about modern C++ features, OpenGL graphics programming, and Rust. I enjoy experimenting with these technologies through personal projects, and writing about them using the Zettelkasten style of note taking.
