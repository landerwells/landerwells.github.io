        <h4>About Me</h4>

        <p>
            Hello! I'm a software developer currenlty at Leidos, where I work on air traffic management systems. My day-to-day tasks mostly include database management with PostgreSQL, or programming in Java, Python and C++.
        </p>

        <p>
            I graduated from Northern Michigan University in May 2024 with a degree in Computer Science. My programming experience primarily revolves around C++, Java, and Rust, though I have a keen interest in learning functional programming. Outside of work, I pursue side projects such as developing a small game in Rust using the Bevy engine.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about self-study, writing (I'm in the early stages of starting a blog!), and reading both fiction and nonfiction. I have competed at an international level in Olympic Weightlifting and have recently taken up running.
        </p>
