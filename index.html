<p>
I’m a software developer at Leidos, working on Air Traffic Control (ATC)
systems. My team is currently developing the front end of the <a href="https://www.leidos.com/markets/aviation/air-traffic-management">Leidos Common
Automation Platform (LCAP)</a> using modern C++ and the Qt framework to display
critical information to ground controllers.
</p>


<p>
Previously, I’ve contributed to other major systems:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/tfdm">TFDM (Terminal Flight Data Manager)</a>: I was responsible for handling the data
received by the sites, packaging it, and handing it off to the FAA. I also
developed Python scripts to automate many tasks that had previously been done
manually, reducing the time required for site development by approximately one
day.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.leidos.com/insights/skyline-x-atm-overview">SkyLine-X</a>: I contributed to features such as Automated Terminal Proximity
Alert (ATPA) and Data Set Reducer (DSR). ATPA provides visual cones in front
of aircraft to indicate safe ranges when following other aircraft during
arrivals. I developed the backend database logic that the C++ application
relied on to retrieve this information, using Java, PostgreSQL, and C++. Data
Set Reducer was designed to define areas around control towers in countries
with limited bandwidth, ensuring that only messages within a specific radius
were received. I implemented the entire backend for this feature, writing the
system in Java, Python, and PostgreSQL to efficiently manage and filter the
data before it reached the C++ frontend. Towards the end of the project, I
also worked on tasks related to rendering the correct information on screen,
integrating the backend data with the visual display.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/eram">ERAM (En Route Automation Modernization)</a>: While an intern at Leidos, I worked
on the display team, fixing graphics and rendering bugs in the C++
application. This involved using GDB for debugging and XML to automate UI
testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Outside of work, I am learning more about modern C++ features, OpenGL graphics
programming, and Rust. I enjoy experimenting with these technologies through
personal projects, and writing about them using the Zettelkasten style of note
taking.
