Titals are vital to a Zetelkasten, specifically, specific ones. If a title is
too vague, then it isn't of very much use to the user. If you cannot tell what
the contens of a note are based off the title, then it is named poorly. There is
nothing wrong with long and descriptive titles when creating notes; it is better
to be overly specific than not specific enough.

The two biggest benefits to specific note titles:

-   Good note titles promote atomicity of notes.  When a title is specific, it
    helps constrain you to writing about one thing. If you are editing and reading
    a note, non-relevant sections to the title will stick out.
-   Easier to find exactly what you are looking for when searching through notes.
    If you are using a digital zettelkasten, the most typical way you will be
    looking for a note is by using its title, hence good titles are more likely to
    find you with the note you are looking for.
