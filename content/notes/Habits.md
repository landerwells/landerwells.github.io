Habits are routine for us, they are the biggest indicator of what we will be
doing in the long-term. They are hard to form and hard to break. Maintaining
good habits decreases our reliance on willpower, a fleeting resource for humans.
Habits also combat the conflict between long-term and short-term interests for
us. Applying strong habits to learning and thinking will allow for a much
greater understanding over time.
