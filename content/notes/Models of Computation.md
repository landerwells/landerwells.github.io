In computer science, a model of computation is a formal framework that describes
how computations are performed. [Lambda calculus]({{< relref "Lambda calculus.md" >}}) and general recursive functions
are functional models, while Turing machines are sequential models. Not all
models of computation have equal computational power, but the ones listed below
are all Turing-complete and thus equivalent in what they can compute:
