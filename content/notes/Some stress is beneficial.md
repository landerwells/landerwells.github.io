Not all stress is detrimental; “Eustress” is a form of stress that is beneficial
for the mind or body. Stress is a necessary condition for growth and
development. Activities like exercising, studying or deliberate practice are all
kinds of stress, but they are intentional ways of increasing our current
capabilities. In lieu of positive forms of stress, our mind and body atrophy:
muscles weaken, minds dull, and skills fade.

The key to positive stress is appropriately selecting activities within your
specific capability range. If you are attempting something too difficult or not
within your current capability range, it will not be a positive stress. Going
too far on either end of this range will result in poorer returns on energy
invested.

Thus, what qualifies as eustress will vary widely from person to person. There
is no universal standard. A marathon runner may find joy in a long daily run,
while the same experience might overwhelm someone new to fitness. The impact of
stress depends on context, experience, and perception: what fosters growth for
one may hinder another.
