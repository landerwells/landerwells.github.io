Previous: [Mathematics]({{< relref "Mathematics.md" >}})

A set `S` of natural numbers is recursively enumerable if there exists an
[algorithm]({{< relref "Algorithm.md" >}}) that enumerates its elements: s₁, s₂, s₃, ... (the algorithm may run
forever for infinite sets).

Examples: x² generates {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...}, the primes {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}

Every computable set is recursively enumerable, but not every recursively
enumerable set is computable.

Recursive enumeration is the process of generating new elements from old ones by
fixed rules.
