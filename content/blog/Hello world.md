Hello and welcome to my first ever blog post! I'll keep this one brief. On my
blog I plan on talking about technical subject such as: [Emacs]({{< relref "Emacs.md" >}}), [Nix]({{< relref "Nix.sync-conflict-20260126-045305-33XBBVQ.md" >}}), [C++]({{< relref "C++.md" >}}), [Rust]({{< relref "Rust.md" >}}),
and [Graphics programming]({{< relref "Graphics programming.md" >}}).

I rebuilt this website using Hugo and Emacs Org-mode after reading about [Hugo
Cisneros](https://hugocisneros.com/blog)' approach on his blog. You may also notice that I stole the note graph
idea from him, to which, I would completely agree. All credit to him, he wrote
the code, I just happened to also use Emacs and Org-mode, so everything worked
out nicely.

My reasons for starting a blog are fairly simple as well. I want to write more
(hopefully improving in the process), and increase visibility on what I am
working on.

Blogs are a tremendously informative resource. It is my preferred source of
media now, so here are a few more that have been informative and inspirational.
