I’m a software developer at Leidos, working on Air Traffic Control (ATC)
systems. I am based in St. Paul, MN, and have experience developing both front
and back end systems. A majority of my professional experience is in C++, with
the rest being in Java, Python, and PostgreSQL.

Currently, I'm on the [Leidos Common Automation Platform
(LCAP)](https://www.leidos.com/markets/aviation/air-traffic-management) team,
where we're performing a complete design refresh of the SkyLine-X frontend. This
involves modernizing the existing C++ codebase and leveraging the Qt framework
to improve usability, performance, and maintainability while preserving the core
functionality that controllers depend on for real-time air traffic management.

Previously, I’ve contributed to other major systems:
- [TFDM (Terminal Flight Data
  Manager)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/tfdm): I was responsible
  for handling the data received by the sites, packaging it, and handing it off
    to the FAA. I also developed Python scripts to automate many tasks that had
    previously been done manually, reducing the time required for site
    development by approximately one day.
- [SkyLine-X](https://www.leidos.com/insights/skyline-x-atm-overview): I
  contributed to features such as Automated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA) and
  Data Set Reducer (DSR). ATPA provides visual cones in front of aircraft to
  indicate safe ranges when following other aircraft during arrivals. I
  developed the backend database logic that the C++ application relied on to
  retrieve this information, using Java, PostgreSQL, and C++. Data Set Reducer
  was designed to define areas around control towers in countries with limited
  bandwidth, ensuring that only messages within a specific radius were received.
  I implemented the entire backend for this feature, writing the system in Java,
  Python, and PostgreSQL to efficiently manage and filter the data before it
  reached the C++ frontend. Towards the end of the project, I also worked on
  tasks related to rendering the correct information on screen, integrating the
  backend data with the visual display.
- [ERAM (En Route Automation
  Modernization)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/eram): While an
  intern at Leidos, I worked on the display team, fixing graphics and rendering
  bugs in the C++ application. This involved using GDB for debugging and XML to
  automate UI testing.

Outside of work, I spend time learning more about Rust and modern C++. I read
technical books and papers, taking notes using the Zettelkasten method. You can
explore my published notes , which cover topics in
systems programming, language features, and software design.
