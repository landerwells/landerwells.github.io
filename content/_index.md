I’m a software developer at Leidos working on Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems.
I’m based in St. Paul, MN. My work spans backend services, databases, and native
applications, primarily in C++, Python, Rust, and PostgreSQL.

I’m currently on the Leidos Common Automation Platform (LCAP) team, contributing
to the modernization of the SkyLine-X GUI and the consolidation of multiple
systems into a single platform.

Previously, I’ve worked on several large national and international ATC
programs: 
- **Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM)**: Developed backend components
  responsible for receiving, validating, and packaging terminal (airport) data
  for delivery to the FAA. Wrote Python automation scripts that replaced manual
    site-development tasks, reducing setup time by roughly one day per site. 
- **SkyLine-X**: Implemented backend systems for multiple operational features: 
    - **Automated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA):** Built database and service
      logic used by the C++ client to compute and retrieve aircraft spacing
      data, enabling visual safety cones during arrival operations. 
    - **Data Set Reducer (DSR):** Designed and implemented the full backend for
      filtering ATC messages by geographic radius in bandwidth-constrained
      environments. The system was written in Java, Python, and PostgreSQL and
      ensured only relevant data reached the C++ frontend. 
- **En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM)** As an intern on the display team,
  fixed graphics and rendering issues in a large C++ codebase. Debugged runtime
  issues using GDB and contributed to automated UI testing driven by XML.

Outside of work, I focus on systems programming and language design, with an
emphasis on modern C++ and Rust. I study technical books and papers and maintain
structured notes using the Zettelkasten method, covering topics such as
low-level design, language features, and software architecture.
