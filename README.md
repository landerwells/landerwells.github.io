Things that I want to add to this site still

- Automation pipeline


- analytics so I can see how many people are visiting my site.
- Fixing some of the formatting for a single page of note. 
- For this need to remove tags on the bottom of each notes, and add a backlinks
  section
- Start integrating citations into workflow
- Email Nicolas P Rougier about the them
