Things that I want to add to this site still

- Working syntax highlighting
- Working published and modified date

- Move index pages into notes, and convert them to org, that way they can be
  easily updated

- Formatting updates
- Need to get search working and better looking notes selection area
- Get RSS feed for blog working

- Could refactor the structure of pages a little bit, notes and blogs will have
  basically the same formatting except notes will have backlinks and blogs wont.
