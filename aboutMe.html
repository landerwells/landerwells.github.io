        <p class="about">My name is Lander Wells! I am currently a junior at Northern Michigan University (NMU) and I am pursuing a Computer Science degree with a minor in Electronics. I started making this website because I enjoyed the process of coding and learning how to use different programming languages.</p>
        <p class="about">Outside of school I compete in Olympic Weightlifting and have a large interest in music. I have been doing both of these things for many years. I started playing the piano when I was in preschool and transitioned to other instruments as I grew up and my tastes in music changed. I began 
            Olympic Weightlifting when I was 8 years old and started competing at a national level by the time I was 12. I have competed internationally at Junior Worlds, and Youth and Junior Pan American Championships. I am also a Youth and Junior National Champion.</p>
